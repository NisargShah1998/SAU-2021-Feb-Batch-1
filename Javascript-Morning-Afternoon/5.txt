Difference between == and ===

== compares only value and not the datatype of both the operands while === compares both value and datatype.

Examples:
1. '10' == 10 // True
   '10' === 10 //False

Here L.H.S is string and R.H.S is number but the content is same i.e. 10.So it will return true in ==.
It will return false in === as datatype is different.

2. 0 == false // True 
   0 === false // False

Here L.H.S is number and R.H.S is boolean but the content is same i.e. 0.So it will return true in ==.
It will return false in === as datatype is different.
